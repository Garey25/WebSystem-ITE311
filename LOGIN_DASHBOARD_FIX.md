# 🔧 Login & Dashboard Fix Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Session Handling Issues**
- **Problem**: Session data wasn't being properly set during login
- **Fix**: Improved session data setting with explicit array structure
- **Files**: `app/Controllers/Auth.php`

### 2. **Redirect URL Issues**
- **Problem**: Using `site_url()` which might cause redirect issues
- **Fix**: Changed to `base_url()` for more reliable redirects
- **Files**: `app/Controllers/Auth.php`

### 3. **Session Persistence**
- **Problem**: Session might not be persisting between requests
- **Fix**: Added explicit session data setting and debugging
- **Files**: `app/Controllers/Auth.php`

### 4. **Debugging Added**
- Added comprehensive logging to track login and session issues
- Added session data logging for troubleshooting

## 🧪 **Test Your System Now:**

### **Step 1: Access the Application**
Go to: `http://localhost:8080`

### **Step 2: Test Login**
Use these test accounts:
- **Admin**: `admin@example.com` / `secret1234`
- **Teacher**: `teacher@example.com` / `secret1234`
- **Student**: `student@example.com` / `secret1234`

### **Step 3: Expected Behavior**
1. **Login** → Should redirect to dashboard
2. **Dashboard** → Should show role-specific content
3. **Navigation** → Should show role-appropriate links
4. **Session** → Should persist between page loads

### **Step 4: Check Logs (if issues persist)**
Look at: `writable/logs/log-2025-09-30.log` for debugging information

## 🔍 **What Should Work Now:**

✅ **Login Process**: 
- Enter credentials → Click login → Redirect to dashboard

✅ **Dashboard Access**:
- Admin sees: System overview, user management
- Teacher sees: Teaching dashboard, course management  
- Student sees: Learning dashboard, course enrollment

✅ **Session Management**:
- Login persists across page refreshes
- Logout properly clears session
- Role-based navigation works

## 🚨 **If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
3. **Check the logs** in `writable/logs/` for detailed error messages
4. **Try different browser** or incognito mode

The system should now work properly with full RBAC functionality! 🎉
