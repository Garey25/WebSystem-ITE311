# Laboratory Activity Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Laboratory Activity for the ITE311-REYES project, which focuses on creating a course enrollment system with AJAX functionality and security testing.

## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration for Enrollments Table ✅
- **File**: `app/Database/Migrations/2025-08-22-081859_CreateEnrollmentsTable.php`
- **Status**: Already existed and was properly configured
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (primary key, auto-increment)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users table)
  - `course_id` (foreign key to courses table)
  - `enrolled_at` (datetime with default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
- **Migration**: Successfully run with `php spark migrate`

### Step 2: Enrollment Model ✅
- **File**: `app/Models/EnrollmentModel.php`
- **Methods Implemented**:
  - `enrollUser($data)`: Inserts new enrollment record with current timestamp
  - `getUserEnrollments($user_id)`: Fetches all courses a user is enrolled in with course details
  - `isAlreadyEnrolled($user_id, $course_id)`: Checks for duplicate enrollments
- **Features**: Proper validation, foreign key relationships, and data integrity

### Step 3: Course Controller ✅
- **File**: `app/Controllers/Course.php`
- **Method**: `enroll()` - Handles AJAX enrollment requests
- **Security Features**:
  - Authentication check
  - Input validation (numeric course_id)
  - Course existence verification
  - Duplicate enrollment prevention
  - JSON response format
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for different scenarios

### Step 4: Student Dashboard View ✅
- **File**: `app/Views/dashboard.php`
- **Sections Added**:
  - **Enrolled Courses**: Displays courses the student is enrolled in with enrollment date
  - **Available Courses**: Shows all available courses with Enroll buttons
- **UI Features**:
  - Bootstrap list groups for clean presentation
  - Responsive design
  - Dynamic content updates
  - Role-based display (only shows for students)

### Step 5: AJAX Enrollment Implementation ✅
- **jQuery Integration**: Added jQuery library to the dashboard
- **AJAX Features**:
  - Prevents default form submission
  - Sends POST request to `/course/enroll`
  - Includes CSRF token for security
  - Shows loading state during enrollment
  - Displays success/error messages
  - Updates UI dynamically without page reload
  - Disables button after successful enrollment
  - Adds enrolled course to the enrolled courses list

### Step 6: Routes Configuration ✅
- **File**: `app/Config/Routes.php`
- **Route Added**: `$routes->post('/course/enroll', 'Course::enroll', ['filter' => 'auth']);`
- **Security**: Protected by authentication filter

### Step 7: Application Testing ✅
- **Server**: Started with `php spark serve`
- **Sample Data**: Created CourseSeeder with 5 sample courses
- **Database**: All migrations and seeders executed successfully
- **Ready for Testing**: Application is ready for comprehensive testing

### Step 8: GitHub Integration ✅
- **Status**: Ready for commit and push
- **Files to Commit**:
  - `app/Models/EnrollmentModel.php`
  - `app/Models/CourseModel.php`
  - `app/Controllers/Course.php`
  - `app/Controllers/Home.php` (updated)
  - `app/Views/dashboard.php` (updated)
  - `app/Config/Routes.php` (updated)
  - `app/Database/Seeds/CourseSeeder.php`
  - `SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

### Step 9: Security Testing Framework ✅
- **Document**: `SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- **Test Categories**:
  - Authorization Bypass Testing
  - SQL Injection Testing
  - CSRF Protection Testing
  - Data Tampering Testing
  - Input Validation Testing
- **Tools**: Browser developer tools, Postman, cURL
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major security vulnerabilities

## Additional Features Implemented

### Course Model
- **File**: `app/Models/CourseModel.php`
- **Purpose**: Manages course data and provides methods for course operations
- **Methods**: `getAllCourses()`, `getCourseById()`

### Sample Data
- **Seeder**: `CourseSeeder.php`
- **Courses Added**:
  1. Introduction to Web Development
  2. PHP Programming Basics
  3. Database Design and Management
  4. CodeIgniter Framework
  5. Frontend Development with Bootstrap

### Security Enhancements
- **CSRF Protection**: Enabled and properly implemented
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Authentication**: All endpoints protected by auth filter
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using CodeIgniter's query builder
- **XSS Protection**: Proper output escaping with `esc()` function

## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enrollments Table
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    course_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    enrolled_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### API Endpoints
- **POST** `/course/enroll` - Enroll user in a course
  - **Authentication**: Required
  - **Parameters**: `course_id` (integer)
  - **Response**: JSON with success/error status and message

### Frontend Technologies
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive UI components
- **jQuery 3.6.0**: For AJAX functionality
- **CodeIgniter 4**: Backend framework
- **PHP 8+**: Server-side language

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   php spark serve
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Login as a student user
   - Navigate to Dashboard

3. **Test Enrollment**:
   - View available courses
   - Click "Enroll" button on any course
   - Verify AJAX functionality (no page reload)
   - Check enrolled courses list updates
   - Test duplicate enrollment prevention

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Follow the `SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Test all security scenarios
   - Verify proper error handling

## Conclusion
